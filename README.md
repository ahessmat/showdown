This is a webapp of the game "20 second showdown".

I wanted to practice my javascript while also cobbling together a game I could play with friends over Zoom.

To run, open index.html.

You can then update the game by uploading any basic text (.txt) file, where each line represents a new category on the wheel. An example file (test3.txt) is included.
